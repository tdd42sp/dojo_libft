# tdd42sp/dojo_libft

This is a Coding Dojo challenge to practice TDD based on the first steps of libft. 

If you don't know what a Coding Dojo maybe you can find out some good information [here](https://github.com/lula42/42Labs/blob/main/dojos.md) (use google translator if necessary 😛).

If you don't know what libft is, probably you should not be here. Try exploring deeply about [42 São Paulo](https://42sp.org.br/) and passing the piscine before trying this Dojo. 😜

The Dojo starts with ft_isalpha. It starts broken on purpose. After you finish ft_isalpha we recommend following this sequence of challenges:

- isalpha
- isdigit
- isalnum
- isascii
- isprint
- strlen

To run the tests you can use this command line:

```
gcc ../src/ft_isalpha.c ./test_ft_isalpha.c -o libft.test && ./libft.test
```
